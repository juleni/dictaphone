# DICTAPHONE - react application

The application converts speech to text and you can then have the recorded words read out. Due to the imperfection of the translation of speech into text, quite humorous results arise :)

### 1. Translating speech to text

Use green icon "microphone" to start listening and converting speech to text
Use red icon "microphone" to stop listening and converting speech to text

### 2. Translating text to speech

Use yellow icon "loudspeaker" to start speech converted text
